## Overall Rating: 6

### General Notes
The bathrooms under the Aula stairs next to the Rautenbach hall are perhaps the most standard bathrooms on campus. Without any flashy designs or interesting features, they are utilitarian if boring. That said, they are well placed and wheelchair accessible, earning them an extra point. They are clean and well kept, with lots of space. 

The Rautenbach bathrooms do have paper towel dispensers as well as condom dispensers, both of which are (at the time of writing) empty, as well as a hand dryer which also was not working losing it any points it may have scored for its appliances. 

All in all, the Rautenbach bathrooms are decent: functional but uninteresting. For now, the bathroom will not lose points for not being well supplied but if the bathroom continues to be understocked this decision may have to be reviewed.
