## Overall Rating: 8

### General Notes
The bathrooms in the Aula auditoriums are setting a high bar for the rest of Hatfield's bathrooms. Aula was relatively clean, barring the standard small pieces of toilet paper on the floor; the design was modern and appealing, with its two partition design separated by a mirror that evokes ideas of modernist art; the bathrooms are wheelchair accessible, with a dedicated disabled bathroom and is accessible by wheelchair ramp.

Aula is also conveniently accessible, sitting just outside of the auditorium and close enough to engineering 3 that the engineers will be able to enjoy it without much trouble. Unfortunately for Aula, there is a distinct lack of sanitary items. Namely, there was neither a hand dryer nor paper towels available; there is also no condom dispenser.
